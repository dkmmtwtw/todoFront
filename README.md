# Scedule Me
1. 
2. Give as many and as truthful constrains/properties to the todo items as you ~~can~~ want.
3. Allow the site, to make a scedule for you. The goal for this project is not only to be able to tell you *when* to do something, but to remind you *Why*. (or provoke the thought that maybe you might not want)
4. A scedule you don't **want** follow is a *thrash* scedule and won't be followed. Include items that aren't in the tipical "necessery bad" or "must do" category, which would otherwise fill a ~~ *(trash)* ~~ scedule, include everything. (you also do happy things, right?)
5. Confess precisely about when you inevitably fail to do as was planned.
6. Allow the site, to suggest into your attention the commonalities of your shortcomings.
7. Repeat from 1, but with more insight to the self.
